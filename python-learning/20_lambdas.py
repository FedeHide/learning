### Lambdas
# Lambdas are a way to create small anonymous functions, i.e. functions without a name.
# They are temporary functions that are needed only once.
# a lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

# Syntax:
# lambda arguments : expression

# Example:
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(5))

# Example 2:
y = lambda a, b: a * b
print(y(5, 6))

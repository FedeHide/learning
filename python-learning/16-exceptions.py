### Exceptions
# Exceptions are errors that are detected during execution. They are not unconditionally fatal, and can be handled by the program.
# Exceptions are raised when the program encounters an error during its execution. They can be handled by the program, and can be used to prevent the program from crashing.

# The try block is used to test a block of code for errors.
# The except block is used to handle the error.
# The else block is used to execute code if no errors are raised.
# The finally block is used to execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.

# Syntax:
# try:
#     # run this code
# except:  --> may or may not have a condition
#     # run this code when there is an exception
# else:
#     # no exception? run this code
# finally:
#     # always run this code
